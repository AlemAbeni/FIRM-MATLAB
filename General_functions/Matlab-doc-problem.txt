The "doc" command is not compatible with the classes that have a "Constant" property, which is initialized by a function.

For example consider following class:

Classdef Sample_class

property (Constant = true)
p1 = initialize_p1();
end

methods
function initialize_p1()
p1 = sqrt(7);
end
end

end

The "doc" function does not work for this class.
